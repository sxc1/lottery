# Features
This started out as a simple Python script (Lottery.py) but is now a fully public React UI hosted via Github Pages.

https://sxc1.github.io/lottery/

Functionality is available for the American Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries. 

## Lottery EV (expected value) calculator
Based on available jackpot values, we provide:

1. Actual take-home value, which is post-tax (~35% federal tax rate), based off of the lump sum cash value option (~45% of the advertised jackpot)
2. Expected value, calculated based on the take-home jackpot, and including non-jackpot prizes, multipliers, and cost to play

## Lottery ticket generator
The ticket generator UI offers two options:

1. A mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium to semi-randomly generate lottery tickets, weighted accordingly with historical data
2. Fully random generation
