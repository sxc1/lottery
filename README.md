# Lottery ticket generator
This is a simple project made by me (sxc1) to use a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium to semi-randomly generate lottery tickets for the American Powerball or Mega Millions lotteries. This does not constitue financial advice or enhanced odds of winning.

Current usage: Lottery.py Python script
WIP: React UI to be hosted on Github Pages
